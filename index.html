    <h1>Britt Spurka</h1>
<p>
Britt Spurka was born February 16, 1997 in Alpharetta, GA. He
spent the majority of his early life involved in sports such as football, basketball,
and baseball. It was not until he was twelve years old that he decided to focus his athletic 
attention on football and lacrosse. He graduated from Cambridge High School in 2015 and began attending
the University of Georgia in August 2015.	
</p>
<p>
In the seventh grade, Britt took up playing the guitar. He continued pursuing his musical interests
throughout high school and into his college years. From 2013 to 2016 he found himself growing increasingly
busy traveling with his band, <b>Sugar On The Dashboard</b>. The band released its first EP entitled <q><i>F.I.N.E.</i></q> 
in September of 2015. However, in July 2016 he parted ways with the group
to focus his attention on his studies. He currently is a musician at Athens Church as well as for the UGA
Wesley Foundation.
</p>
<p>
In August 2016, Britt accepted his scholarship with the UGA Army ROTC program. Accordingly, he now receives a
free education in return for four years of service after graduation. Britt is currently studying International Business 
and Finance at UGA and plans to attend law school following his departure from the Army.
